**OB-Xf Nightly Build**

This page contains a copy of OB-Xf built from the head of the repository. We consider this a beta build.

To install on your system, download the appropriate installer (dmg, exe, deb) and run it.

We also provide a ZIP file for Windows and Linux, but when using these you are responsible for placing the assets from the `assets` folder contained within to the right location on your system. If you take this route and get it wrong, run the standalone and it will show you where it attempted to look for assets.

We have a few items left to do between beta and a 1.0, including finishing MIDI learn UI/UX and resolving other bugs in the beta period, but the synth is stable now.

Enjoy!
